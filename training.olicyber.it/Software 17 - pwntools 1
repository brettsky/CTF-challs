Typically when facing pwn challenges it is common to interact with a program running remotely on a server.

To make writing solutions easier, you can use pwntools , a Python library that offers several features, such as:

Tubes : I/O wrapper for remote connections or local binaries
Packing : Conversions between numbers and bytes in little/big endian
ELFs : Load and parse ELFs directly from Python
Assembly : Assemble code on the fly
GDB Debug: Debuggare programmi con gdb
pwntoolsIt therefore allows us to write Python scripts that interact with a service locally or remotely.

To install pwntools on Ubuntu you can run the following commands from the command line:


$ apt install python3 python3-pip python3-dev
$ pip3 install pwntools
In this challenge, you are asked to connect to a remote server and solve some simple arithmetic expressions.

Among the attachments you will find a python file script.pythat uses the library pwntoolsand some examples of interaction with a remote server.

You can connect to the remote service with the command:

nc software-17.challs.olicyber.it 13000

We are given the following script to start "software-17_given.py" 




Using the command to connect we get the message 

* Welcome to the first Pwntools challenge                          *
* You will receive a list of numbers, add them up and give me the result   *
* If you are fast enough, you will get the flag                      *
* You will have to complete 10 steps in 10 seconds                      *

We complete the ten steps in software-17_given.py

And get the flag flag{455b7c904a9fb4a6}
