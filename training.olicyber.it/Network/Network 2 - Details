This challenge requires you to analyze some packages in more detail. Specifically, the flag is in the following format:

flag{Source_MAC_address/data_bytes_length}

The information needed for the flags is taken from frame number 4, the first one containing the session data TCP.


Step 1.  Find the source mac Source_MAC_address which is in the Ethernet II part of the packet 26:0e:ad:ef:c6:65

Step 2 find the data bytes length in the data part of the packet (63 bytes)
