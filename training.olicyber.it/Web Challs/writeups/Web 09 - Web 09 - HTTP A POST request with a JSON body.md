application/x-www-form-urlencoded, despite its historical diffusion, is an obsolete format and not very suitable for representing structured data, which is why it has been gradually supplanted, in those applications that do not require compatibility with the traditional web form submission mechanism, by more modern formats such as XMLand JSON.

The flag will be returned in the response text.
