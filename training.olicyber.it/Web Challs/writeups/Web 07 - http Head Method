Sometimes, a client may want to know the metadata of a resource without necessarily receiving the entire representation (think, for example, of a large file). For these specific situations, the HTTP protocol provides the HEAD verb, designed to obtain the headers of an equivalent GET request in response, but without actually transferring the resource.

The headers shown should be identical to those of a similar GET request, but as with the header Accept, a faulty or misconfigured server can accidentally leak additional information that would not be included in the response to a normal GET request.

The goal of this challenge is to make a HEAD request to the resource http://web-07.challs.olicyber.it/and observe the returned headers. It is recommended to use the library's headrequests function , which has similar uses to the get.

In this challenge we learned how to use the request module to send a head request then print those headers out
