Description
The login system has been upgraded with a basic rate-limiting mechanism that locks out repeated failed attempts from the same source. Weâ€™ve received a tip that the system might still trust user-controlled headers. Your objective is to bypass the rate-limiting restriction and log in using the known email address: ctf-player@picoctf.org and uncover the hidden secret.
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

This challenge I also solved in burp. 

Using the clues from the prompt and the intruder function of burpsuite I was able to get the correct password and the flag

"success":true,"email":"ctf-player@picoctf.org","firstName":"pico","lastName":"player","flag":"picoCTF{xff_byp4ss_brut3_6cf524b1}"

The solution to this challenge was the pitchfork attack and the X-Forwarded-For header


becuase the server still accepts user controller headers, changing the x-forwarderd-for header every request let us bypass the rate limit 

a list of 20 ips was used to try every password
