Opening the challenge we see <!-- ABGR: Wnpx - grzcbenel olcnff: hfr urnqre "K-Qri-Npprff: lrf" -->

In the HTML source

We try to decode using "https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher" 

We see it is a ROT13 cipher <!-- NOTE: Jack - temporary bypass: use header "X-Dev-Access: yes" -->

This is a note saying we need to pass the custom X header to the webserver to login

With  this knowledge I used burp to solve this challenge. I sent a login request that failed. 

I then sent that to the repeater tab in burp add repeated the request with the correct header. The flag was in the server response
