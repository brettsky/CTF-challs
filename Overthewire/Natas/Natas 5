This challenge is all about cookies. 

Navigating to our developer tools we can see a cookie value for loggedin
it is currently set to 0, we can assume this means "False" Setting it to 1 and reloading gives us the pass

we can also use curl to see the cookies being sent to us: curl -v -u natas5:*************  http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/

gives the output Set-Cookie: loggedin=0

another curl command with the header  curl -v -b "loggedin=1" -u natas5:***************** http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/

gives us the pass for natas6 

<!-- This stuff in the header has nothing to do with the level -->

Access granted. The password for natas6 is 0RoJwHdSKWFTYR5WuiAewauSuNaBXned
